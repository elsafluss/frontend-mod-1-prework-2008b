//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = [ "Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant" ];
console.log( animals );

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
console.log( animals[ 0 ] );

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log( animals.length );

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[ 2 ] = "Gorilla";
console.log( animals );

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push( "Platypus" );
console.log( animals )

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.unshift( "Elephant" );
console.log( animals );
animals[ 0 ];
console.log( animals[ 0 ] )


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var dairy = [ "milk", "cheese", "sour cream", "heavy cream" ]

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log( dairy.length );

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
dairy.push( "broccoli" );
console.log( dairy )

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
dairy.pop();
console.log( dairy )

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
// There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
dairy.push( "yogurt", "ice cream", "whey" );
console.log( dairy )

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
dairy.shift();
console.log( dairy )


//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = [ "image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby" ];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: In Discord, a single user in a server can have many roles assigned to them. var user["role1", "role2", "role3"]
// 2: In Discord, you can favorite gifs to put them into a folder that's easy to access. var favoriteGif["no", "scream", "run away"]
// 3: On Spotify, an artist has many albums. var artist["debut", "sophomore"]

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
// sets value of percentBatteryLeft variable (number)
var percentBatteryLeft = 10;
// sets value of hasCharger variable (boolean)
var hasCharger = true;
// sets value of chargerType variable (string)
var chargerType = "car";

// checks if value of percentBatteryLeft is greater than or equal to 15
if ( percentBatteryLeft >= 15 ) {
  // if value of percentBatteryLeft is greater than or equal to 15, prints "Call that Uber"
  console.log( "Call that Uber" );
  // if value of percentBatteryLeft is not greater than or equal to 15, checks values of hasCharger and chargerType
} else if ( hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car" ) {
  // if value of hasCharger is true AND chargerType matches "car", prints "You'd better call now"
  console.log( "You'd better call now" );
  // if neither of those if statements are satisfied, checks this (empty) else statement
} else {
  // prints "Hope you're wearing walking shoes"
  console.log( "Hope you're wearing walking shoes" );
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
