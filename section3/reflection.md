## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * That being able to accept critical feedback is part of having a growth mindset. It totally makes sense, I just hadn't put the two together.
  * The myth of the brilliant developer: no one is more or less brilliant (in any huge amount, anyway) - there are just some people who grow more and faster than others because they embrace the growth.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * Being a mom forced me to adopt a growth mindset in a lot of way. Even if I felt like I knew exactly what I was doing one day (very rare), kids are always changing, and I needed to hold loosely to everything I thought I knew about mothering. I have to strive to keep learning more about being a mom, and learning more about my kids, to continue being the best mom I can be.
  * I do get stubborn sometimes, though. If I'm playing a board game and I can see that I have no chance of winning, I tend to give up and/or cause chaos instead of trying to figure out what went wrong.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  * If you want to send the same text message to three of your friends (assume a group message is not automatically created), you'd enter their phone numbers (each number is an item in the array), then enter the text to be sent. Your phone could send the message to the first one, iterate to the next number, send it to that one, iterate to the next number, and so on.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  * A method is a set action that you can apply to an array. So an array method is a way to _do something_ to an array, or a way to get certain information about it. Example, .length tells you how many items are in the array, .pop removes the last item in the array, and .sort changes the order of the items in the array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  * A loop is like a condensed if statement. You can use a loop to run through a series of steps a certain number of times, instead of coding each of those steps individually.
  * If you want to act on some or all of the items in an array, you would use a loop with that array.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  * Set out a handful of skittles. If there is more than 2 skittles in the pile, give one to me and one to you. Otherwise, give a skittle to your mom. Now we have split the skittles evenly between us, and maybe mom gets one at the end.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  * Y'all. I did NOT understand loops after the try coding a few months ago, and I was worried that I just wouldn't get the concept. But I get it! I've written down the steps a loop goes through at least twice in my notebook, plus with all these exercises, I definitely got up and did a little dance when I finished.
