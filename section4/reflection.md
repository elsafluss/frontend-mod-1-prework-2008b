## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
 * I appreciated the reminders to get up and stretch, but at times I just really didn't want to - I felt like about half the time it interrupted my flow, which was annoying.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
 * I had already been writing out a checklist of what I needed to accomplish, so that part wasn't new. I definitely didn't know how long tasks would take before I was working on them, but this is something that I'm sure I'll get better at as time goes on. I did find that I need to hide my "time left" from myself, or I just focus on that instead of focusing on the work I need to do.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
 * An object is a variable that holds an unordered group name:value pairs. An array is a container for an ordered group of values of the same type.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    * Array - it's a list of names (strings).
  * List of states and their capitals
    * Array - these values will not change, and can be listed in a single string as "state, capital".
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    * Array - it's just a list of items, unless you want to track whether an item has been packed or not.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    * Array - you're only listing the names of accounts, and you can order it in the array.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    * Object - they're paired values, and you might want to add a var like age or isPassing.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    * Object - each ingredient is different, and each amount is different.
  * All my favorite restaurants
    * Array - an ordered list would be a good way to rank them. If you wanted to list their addresses, phone numbers and price points, then you'd want to use an object.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
 * In the MLB app I use, you can view a scoreboard of ongoing and just-ended games. Some of the keys you can view are homeTeam ("Cubs"), awayTeam ("Reds"), homeTeamRecord ("12-5"), awayTeamRecord ("7-10"), homeTeamScore (3), awayTeamScore (0), halfInning (bottom 9th).

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
 * I put some questions at the bottom of a couple of the exercises.
